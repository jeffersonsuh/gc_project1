# gc_project1

project1 is a project presentation created by Jefferson Suh, Jackson Qualley, Haruna Suzuki, and Autumn Kwon for CSC-151-03 during the Fall 2019 semester at Grinnell College.

Our goal with the project was to write a program that analyzes data on the most popular and successful movies in the past decades and to create a graph to visualize the data and compare the effects of categories on “successfulness” in movies.

We used csv data files from kaggle.com:
[Boxofficemojo Alltime Domestic Data (April 2018)](https://www.kaggle.com/eliasdabbas/boxofficemojo-alltime-domestic-data)
[Movie Industry: Three decades of movies (2016)](https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies)

We presented our project on December 11th, 2019.
